## 📌 Project Overview

Our project is a **Google Drive Clone**, a secure and scalable cloud-based file storage and management system. It allows users to upload, organize, share, and manage files through a web interface, supporting both relational and non-relational data models. The architecture emphasizes usability, modularity, analytics capabilities, and performance.

### 🔑 Key Features

- File upload, download, and version control  
- Folder creation and hierarchical organization  
- Role-based sharing and permission management  
- Metadata indexing and access logging  
- Dashboard with analytical metrics  
- Hybrid architecture with SQL and NoSQL databases  
- Deployment using Railway (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
