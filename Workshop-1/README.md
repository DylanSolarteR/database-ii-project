# Workshop-1 â€“ Google Drive Clone

This repository contains the deliverables for **Workshop 1** of the course project, which outlines the initial design and business model for a cloud-based file management platform inspired by Google Drive.

## ðŸ“˜ Sections Overview

### 1. Project Overview
This section includes a general introduction to the project, highlighting the goal of developing a secure, scalable, and user-friendly Google Drive clone. The solution focuses on features such as file sharing, synchronization, mobile access, and fine-grained permissions.

### 2. User Stories
A detailed list of 20+ user stories is provided, each with priority, time estimate, and acceptance criteria. Key functionalities include:
- Secure file upload
- Folder organization
- File sharing with permissions
- Drag-and-drop upload
- File synchronization
- Mobile access
- Activity logs
- Two-factor authentication
- Analytics dashboard

### 3. Business Model Canvas
An adapted Business Model Canvas identifies the project's value propositions, key partners, customer relationships, cost structure, revenue streams, and core resources.

### 4. Functional Requirements
Specifies all platform capabilities grouped in categories such as:
- User Management
- File Management
- Folder Organization
- Content Search
- Sharing and Collaboration
- Mobile Support
- Plans and Quotas
- File Security
- Integration with external services
- Analytics and Reporting

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements
Describes system-level characteristics, including:
- Performance and responsiveness
- Scalability (up to 5,000 concurrent users)
- Security standards (AES encryption, brute-force protection)
- Usability and responsiveness
- Compatibility with modern browsers
- Maintainability and modular architecture
- Internationalization (English and Spanish support)

### 6. Initial Architecture
A modular, hexagonal architecture is proposed, composed of:
- **API Gateway**
- **Domain Layer** (FileService, SharingService, etc.)
- **Adapters Layer** (MongoDB, S3, Redis, Elasticsearch, Neo4j)
- **Analytics & Monitoring** (InfluxDB, Prometheus, SendGrid)
- **External Integrations** (Auth0, cloud storage, email)

### 7. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
Defines the key entities and relationships in the system:
- USER, FILE, FOLDER, TAG, ACTIVITY_LOG, SHARING, SHARED_LINK, etc.
- Includes support for versioning, favorites, tagging, and permission models.
